## Competitive Landscape
### The [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)
“In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”
― [Herbert Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon)

*Attention is a scarcity, wherever it flows, money (impact, influence, power) will follow*

## Economic Risks
### [Neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism)
* [Lemon socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_socialism) - privatizing profits, socializing losses
* [Too big to fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)
* The end of the [Grand Supercycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_supercycle)
* [Nixon shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock)
* [Zombie companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_company)

*Central bankers have joined the spivs and speculators at the roulette table*

## Lifelong Learning
“In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.”
― [Eric Hoffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hoffer)

*[Lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning) needs to become the norm not the exception*

## Topic Hacking
### Curiosity is a fundamental human trait

Borrows elements from:
* [Hacker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)
* [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)

A flexible approach to lifelong learning, that is both inclusive and scalable

Relevant and useful in the changing reality of our world
[VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity)

## Hacker Culture
* Creating software and sharing it with each other
* Placing a high value on **freedom of inquiry**
* Hostility to secrecy
* **Information-sharing** as both an ideal and a practical strategy
* Upholding the **right to fork**
* Emphasis on rationality
* Distaste for authority
* Playful cleverness, *taking the serious humorously and humour seriously*

Convergent Thinking ↔ Divergent Thinking

## Topic Hacking 
### Activities and outputs
* [Perpetual beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta) - knowledge debt
* [Process tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_tracing) - thinking aloud, change logs, issue trackers
* Generating artefacts
* Illustrating
* Summarizing
* Annotating
* Cross-referencing
* Decision-making
* ...
* **[LIVING DOCUMENTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document)**

## Why get involved in Topic Hacking?
### Similar motivations apply to those in the open-source software movement:
* Altruism
* Community sharing and improvement
* Recognition
* Creative expression
* ...
* Learning & unlearning

## Topic Hacking
*Keep it simple*
### Use the loops of learning as scaffolding

**Single-loop learning** - Following the rules
*Are we doing things right?*

**Double-loop learning** - Changing the rules
*Are we doing the right things?*

**Triple-loop learning** - Learning about learning
*How can we be sure what’s right is right?*
